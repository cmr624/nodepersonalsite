Based loosely on true events, the team and I thought it would be interesting to explore putting users directly in control of a character who experiences the perils of online dating. Being able to swipe through and actually choose someone to talk to was a big part of the concept; we liked the idea that players would be willingly (and unknowingly) choosing someone to date who later (mild spoilers!) becomes aggressive and problematic. You play as an unnamed woman in college who is trying a Tinder-like dating app for the first time. The app is currently in development and the targeted release date is 2018.",
