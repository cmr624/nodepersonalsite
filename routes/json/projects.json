You are able to send anonymous questions to the professor and they can answer them live.

I was in charge of creating and delegating tasks, writing out the task requirements, and working on all aspects to make sure the vision was consistent. We broke up the design based on its core tenets of functionality: the design, user authentication and saving user data in a database (MongoDB), socket.io for real-time 'chatroom' like features, node.js to run the app, and HTML and CSS to implement the design.",
